        <h2>Asynchronous & Synchronous</h2>
        <p>Creo offers two operational modes for executing applications: synchronous and asynchronous.<span class="read-more" onclick="toggleContent('post4')">Read more...</span></p>
        <div class="full-content">
            <p>
                <h3>Synchronous Mode</h3><br/>                 
                   In synchronous mode, Creo Parametric initiates application execution based on data stored in the registry file. There are two sub-modes within synchronous mode:<br/><br/>

                     <i>Synchronous DLL:</i> This mode involves direct function calls for interaction. The application is launched and managed by the Pro/Engineer application, leveraging Pro/Engineer resources. It starts with a user_initialize entry point and concludes with user_terminate.<br/><br/>
                    <i>Synchronous Multi-Process (spawned):</i> Here, interaction occurs via an Inter-Process messaging system. The application is launched as a separate entity by the Pro/Engineer application, with the main entry point. <br/><br/>
                    <em>Note: </em>Each process within this mode can communicate by sending messages to one another, typically requesting specific operations. However, each process must wait for a return message confirming completion of the operation, resulting in one process always being in a wait state.<br/>                
                <h3>Asynchronous Mode</h3>
                A synchronous Mode enables simultaneous operations between the Creo Parametric Toolkit application and Creo Parametric through a multiprocess setup. The application initializes independently of Creo Parametric, then either launches or establishes a connection with a Creo Parametric process.<br/><br/>
                <i>Simple Asynchronous: </i>In Simple Asynchronous Mode, there's no mechanism for handling requests from Creo Parametric to the Creo Parametric Toolkit application. Consequently, Creo Parametric cannot directly invoke functions within the toolkit application. Instead, both processes operate concurrently.<br/><br/>
                <i>Fully Asynchronous:</i> In Fully Asynchronous Mode, the setup remains similar to Simple Asynchronous Mode, but with a crucial difference in how the Creo Parametric Toolkit application manages requests from Creo Parametric. Here, the application must incorporate a control loop to actively monitor and respond to messages received from Creo Parametric. It's worth noting that asynchronous applications won't be visible in the auxiliary applications dialog box.<br/><br/>          </i>

        <h2>Setting Up An Asynchronous Application</h2>
        <p>
            To enable communication between your asynchronous application and Creo Parametric, you need to configure the environment variable PRO_COMM_MSG_EXE. <span class="read-more" onclick="toggleContent('post5')">Read more...</span></p>
        <div class="full-content">
            <p>This variable should point to the complete path of the pro_comm_msg.exe executable, located at (creo_loadpoint)\Common Files\obj\pro_comm_msg.exe. You can set PRO_COMM_MSG_EXE in the Environment Variables section within the System settings accessed through the Control Panel.The environment variable RPC_TIMEOUT establishes the maximum duration within which remote procedure calls must be carried out. It operates in seconds, with a default setting of 2000 seconds. In case the application exceeds this time limit without finishing execution, it returns the error PRO_TK_COMM_ERROR. If your application demands additional time for execution, you should adjust this variable to a higher value.</p>

        <h2>Create New CAD Files</h2>
        <p>Please follow the steps outlined below to generate a new CAD file in Creo.<span class="read-more" onclick="toggleContent('post6')">Read more...</span></p>
        <div class="full-content">
            <p>
            <ol><li><p><strong>Get the template path:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Before starting a new CAD file, locate the template file you'll use. Templates contain predefined settings like units, layers, and components, streamlining the design process.</li></ul></li>
                <li><p><strong>Load the template to Creo session:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Once you find the template, open it within Creo by navigating to its location. This action loads the template into the Creo environment for use.</li></ul></li>
                   <p><strong>Use ProMdlFiletypeLoad() to load the object:</strong></p>
                    <ul>This function is employed to bring an object into the current Creo session from various locations, such as disk paths, workspace paths, or commonspace paths.</li></ul></li>
                <li><p><strong>Rename the file to the required part number:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>After loading the template, rename the file to match the specific part number or name associated with the new CAD file. This step maintains organization and clarity in your project.</li></ul></li>
                <p><strong>Rename the file with ProMdlRename:</strong></p>
                <ul>Once the object is loaded, use <code>ProMdlRename</code> to change its name. This function allows you to update the object's name to better suit your project needs.</ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Create or Retrieve a window with ProObjectwindowMdlnameCreate:</strong></p>
                        <ul><li>This function retrieves a window and attaches the object to it. If the window is already open with the object attached, it returns the window ID. It helps manage the workspace efficiently.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Activate the window:</strong></p>
                    <ul><li>Ensure the correct window or workspace is active for working on the new CAD file. Activating the window ensures any actions or commands apply to the correct document in Creo.</li></ul></li>
                                <p><strong>Activate the window using ProWindowActivate:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>Ensure the appropriate window is active for working on the CAD file. Activating the window allows you to interact with the CAD model effectively within Creo.</ul></ol>    
                                    Following these steps, you can efficiently create new CAD files in Creo</p>

            <p>
            <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p><strong>Solid Coordinate System</strong>: Utilized in Creo Parametric for 3D modeling, describing geometry in Cartesian coordinates for parts and assemblies. It visualizes surfaces, edges, and assembly member positions and orientations. Solid coordinates correspond to dimension values seen by users and are integral to geometry-based functions in Creo Parametric TOOLKIT.</p><p><strong>Screen Coordinate System</strong>: Acts as an intermediary for 2D positioning within the Creo Parametric window, facilitating graphics rendering and user interactions. It transforms points to screen pixels, maintaining consistency even with view adjustments like zoom and pan.</p><p><strong>Window Coordinate System</strong>: Similar to screen coordinates but tailored for screen resolution and adjustments like zoom and pan. It maps models from the screen coordinate system before rendering to screen pixels, ensuring accurate representation regardless of view modifications.</p><p><strong>Drawing Coordinate System</strong>: Employed for 2D positioning on drawing sheets, measured in drawing units. It describes positions relative to the bottom-left corner, crucial for precise drafting tasks, and often utilized by Creo Parametric TOOLKIT functions handling drawings.</p><p><strong>Drawing View Coordinate System</strong>: Used to locate entities within a drawing view, aiding accurate placement of elements within drawings for effective communication of design intent.</p><p><strong>Assembly Coordinate System</strong>: Establishes positions, orientations, and geometry of parts, subassemblies, and datum features within an assembly. Each assembly member maintains its solid coordinate system, vital for analyzing subassembly geometry relative to the parent assembly.</p><p><strong>Datum Coordinate System</strong>: A user-defined coordinate system within parts or assemblies, essential for describing geometry relative to specific reference points, often utilized in Creo Parametric TOOLKIT applications.</p><p><strong>Section Coordinate System</strong>: Unique coordinate system for each sketch, facilitating entity placement within the sketch and features. Sketches used in features may have a different coordinate system from the solid model, ensuring accurate geometry representation.</p></div>
